At the moment you can add a device and with one of my MCUs such as M5Core2, the device's monitoring is updated onto the server. This will evolve in due time to where apps will be hosted for the TDeck project I have been working on. The next thing to be updated here will be an iMessage clone to keep messages sent from LoRa to the cloud .",
